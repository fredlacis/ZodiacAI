# Zodiac AI
A project originally devoleped for an artificial intelligence programming course teached by [Augusto Baffa](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/blog/professor/@augusto-baffa)
at the Pontificial Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, implemented in Python, with the help of the PyGame engine.

## Installation
	
  * We recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), and you can get it clicking on the name itself. But as we speak, it's only
 a recommendation and if you prefer, you can use [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
	* To install pygame, you have to open Anaconda Prompt as admin, and type "pip install Pygame==2.0.0dev12"

## Usage
