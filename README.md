# Zodiac AI
A project originally devoleped for an artificial intelligence programming course teached by [Augusto Baffa](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/blog/professor/@augusto-baffa)
at the Pontificial Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, implemented in Python, with the help of the PyGame engine.

## Installation
> We recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), and you can get it clicking on the name itself. But as we speak, it's only
 a recommendation and if you prefer, you can use [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 
> To install pygame, you have to open Anaconda Prompt as admin, and type "pip install Pygame==2.0.0dev12"

## Usage

### Map Creation

> For map generation we use .csv files, which can edit and then downloaded via this [google sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tFr6lNetuc4RzEoR4XWS24l3rupBcPPf2lXDDH0PMkE/edit?usp=sharing). <br> After downloading your desired map, you must put it in the maps folder of the project and insert its name in the main.py file.

### Algorithm Execution

> Pressing spacebar the A* algorithm starts running.<br>
